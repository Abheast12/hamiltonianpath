# hamiltonianpath
The Hamiltonian Path problem is a known NP hard problem with no efficient solution. However, there is existing research to find a Hamiltonian Path with high accuracy using a randomized algorithm.
This application will, given a graph, find a Hamiltonian Path efficiently with high accuracy using a randomized algorithm. To run it, type the following into the console:
